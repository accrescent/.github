## About

Accrescent is a private and secure Android app store built with modern features in mind. It aims to
provide a developer-friendly platform and pleasant user experience while enforcing modern security
and privacy practices and offering robust validity guarantees for installed apps.

## Features

- **App signing key pinning**: first-time app installs are verified so you don't have to [TOFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use).
- **Signed repository metadata**: repository contents are protected against malicious tampering.
- **Automatic, unattended, unprivileged updates (Android 12+)**: updates are handled seamlessly without relying on privileged OS integration.
- **Designed for split APKs**: downloaded APKs are optimized for your device to save bandwidth.
- **No remote APK signing**: developers are in full control of their app signing keys.
- **No account required**: users don't need an account to install apps, improving privacy.
